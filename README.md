# turnio-duckduckgo-replit

An example Turn.io suggested reply integration on Replit. This will return the abstract from the DuckDuckGo API as a suggested reply in the Turn.io UI

## How to run this Repl.it example

Click the Run on Repl.it button below to install this code example into your Repl.it workspace. Repl.it creates a free workspace for you to do this in. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one in the process at no cost or further commitments.

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/turnhub/turnio-duckduckgo-replit)](https://repl.it/github/turnhub/turnio-duckduckgo-replit)

When it has completed installing the code into your workspace, click the `Run` button at the top of the Repl.it browser window.

This will start the application on a URL provided by Repl.it. In the screenshot you will notice that it is https://turnio-duckduckgo.turnio.repl.co/ but it will be different for your own workspace.

Please take note that the default example expects Turn to communicate with the integration at the `/context` path.

Now log-in to your account on Turn. For most this will be at https://app.turn.io. If you're on a private cloud setup then please reach out to Turn.io Support via WhatsApp if you're unsure about the address of your Turn installation.

Go to the `Settings` section.

Then click on the `Integrations` tab and select `Custom Integration` from the `Add an Integration` drop down menu.

Provide the URL generated by `Repl.it` and append the `/context` path to it. At the moment Turn requires one to supply an authentication header. For this example we are not requiring that in the backend, feel free to type `123` or anything else in the API Token field.

Click on the `Create Integration` button. 

Now whenever you open a chat in Turn, it will request a best reply from [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) and display that in the Turn user interface as a best reply response to an incoming message.
